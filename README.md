# DailyBot-Third-Prototype


## Introduction

This is my third prototype of the DailyBot chatbot. The final microservice that is expected to be built should have the following requirements:

1. Be trained with a base of predefined set of intentions.
2. Recognize the intent of a received message.
3. Support English and Spanish
4. Provide an intention-based response generator
